# GlobalWoZ: Globalizing MultiWoZ to Develop Multilingual Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems
Dear GlobalWoZ users, we are publishing all the data soon. Please give us some time. Thanks a lot. 

# V2.0 Beta
Here is the link to GlobalWoZ v2.0 Beta. We are uploading the data now. In the V2.0, we post edited all 1000 the translated templates for test data. We spotted some issues of the entities misalignment in GlobalWoZ V1.0 and thus we fixed them in GlobalWoZ V2.0. We also further cleaned the collected ontologies for all the languages and standardized the names of Dialogue ID. We will soon release the experiment results and the code implementation for GlobalWoZ V2.0 soon.
